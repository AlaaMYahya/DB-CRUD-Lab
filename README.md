# CRUD operations with Supabase 

Finish the Supabase lab we did in class. Which is creating a Flutter project that connects to Supabase and performing CRUD operations on the "Member" table.

Here are the tasks you need to perform:
- Add a new member to the table
- Update an existing member
- Display all registered members
- Remove a member from the table
